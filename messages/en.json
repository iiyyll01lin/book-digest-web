    "storyPara2": "Strangers became reading buddies,\nand over time we figured out how we liked to read and talk together,\nnot just about books, but about life, ideas, and everything in between.\nAnd that's how BookDigest was born.\n\nEach month, we will pick the book.\nWe read everything from novels and psychology to world history and personal finance.\nSometimes it's something we'd totally pick for ourselves,\nother times, it's way outside our comfort zone (in the best way).\nThere's something magical about seeing the world through someone else's bookshelf.",
    "storyPara3": "We believe reading isn't just about taking in information,\nit's about chewing on ideas, reflecting, discussing, and slowly letting it all sink in.\nKnowledge only truly becomes yours when you've taken the time to digest it.\nWe meet at a different cafe each month,\nso if you love a good book, meaningful conversations,\nand a really great cup of coffee,\ncome hang out with us at BookDigest!",

    "reason2Title": "Deep, delightful and diverse conversations",
    "reason2Desc": "We come from all sorts of backgrounds — engineers, designers, teachers, finance folks, you name it.\nAnd when we read something topic-specific, we sometimes invite someone with real-life experience to join the conversation.\nThat's what makes our book club both deep and fun at the same time!",
    "reason3Title": "Chill Vibes, No Pressure",
    "reason3Desc": "Think of it more like catching up with friends than a formal discussion.\nNo need to prep a presentation, just bring the book you read (and your lovely self)!\nEveryone shares their favorite chapters or adds something extra the book didn't cover.\nCome hang out and chat with us!",
